Merged is an effort making the Project Management tools that developers use, effortlessly manageable at one place. Merged is a react app that will have features like:

Adding/Removing multiple Github Accounts

The idea here is to have a client that can use Project management abilities of Github and make the maximum use of it. Adding and Removing Tasks should be easier for Project Managers and Developers. End Users(Non Technical team) should have easier way to add issues to Project. This app will be a better project tracking mechanism.
